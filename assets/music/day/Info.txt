Day - 24 beats at 155bpm, meaning a new track should be played every ~9.29 seconds (some tracks are double or half this length, marked as such in titles).
Blank tracks should be played more often than fills, and consecutive blank tracks should tend to be of the same type
(i.e. Blank 1 is more likely to follow another Blank 1 than Blank 2 is)
