Day - 12 beats at 155bpm, meaning a new track should be played every ~4.65 seconds (the intro is double this, and is marked as such in its title).
Transitions (hopefully) seamlessly from the day ambience, so it should be able to fit in with the current queue system.
Blank tracks should be played more often than fills, as before.
